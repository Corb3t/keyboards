# keyboards
This is my keyboard. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My keyboard is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

## Welcome
I got sick of keeping track of all the custom keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures that I've created, so I decided to create this guide to make setting this up a little easier down the road. If you think my keyboard shortcuts could be improved upon in some way, do not hesitate to contact me.

## Applications Used
* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) - The must-have application for setting up custom keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures.
* [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - A powerful keyboard customizer, used to remap "Capslock" to "Hyper + Escape" (see below)
