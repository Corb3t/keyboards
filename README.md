## Welcome
I got sick of keeping track of all the custom keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures that I've created, so I decided to create this guide to make setting this up a little easier down the road. If you think my keyboard shortcuts could be improved upon in some way, do not hesitate to contact me.

## Applications
* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) - The must-have application for setting up custom keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures.
* [Alfred 5](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Save countless hours by using hotkeys, keywords and customizing how you want to search your Mac and activity history.
* [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - A powerful keyboard customizer, used to remap "Capslock" to "Hyper + Escape" (see below)

## Searchbars

### Alfred
<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> 

Like spotlight search, but better. Alfred has a long list of features.

### Clipboard History
<kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>

I use the clipboard history to easily copy and paste images and text anywhere.

### Keyboard Snippets
<kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>

Great for quickly filling in information you regularly use like e-mails, dates, and links.

### Raindrop
<kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>

My favorite bookmark manager. I use the Raindrop searchbar to quickly open links to my Github projects, work-related Sharepoint pages, Google Drive folders, and more.

### 1Password
<kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>

My favorite password manager. The 1Password searchbar lets me quickly open and login to a website with just a few keystrokes. 1Password can even be used as a 2fa authenticator app, and auto-fill the code into your browser of choice (I suggest [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)).

## Trackpad Gestures - BetterTouchTool
For Trackpad gestures, I use [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/). BTT lets you create gestures and keyboard shortcuts on a global and per-app basis, allowing flexibility.

### Browser Gestures
When I am working in a web browser, the following trackpad gestures allow me to...

* Three Finger Swipe Right - Navigate to right tab
* Three Finger Swipe Left - Navigate to left tab
* Three Finger Swipe Down - Close active tab
* Three Finger Swipe Up - Open new tab
